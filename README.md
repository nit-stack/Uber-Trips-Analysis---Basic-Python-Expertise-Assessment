# Uber Trips Analysis - Basic Python Expertise Assessment
# Project Overview 
This project aims to evaluate the basic Python skills of students by performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Uber trips. The dataset contains various details about trips made by Uber drivers, including the starting and stopping points, distance traveled, and the purpose of the trip.
# Questions and Tasks
The analysis involves answering the following questions and performing the associated tasks:

1. Show the last 10 records of the dataset.
2. Show the first 10 records of the dataset.
3. Show the dimension (number of rows and columns) of the dataset.
4. Show the size (total number of elements) of the dataset.
5. Display the information about all the variables in the dataset.
6. Check for missing values.
7. How many missing values are present?
8. Get the summary of the original data.
9. Drop the missing values and store the data in a new DataFrame (name it "df").
10. Check the information of the new DataFrame (df).
11. Get the unique start destinations.
12. What is the total number of unique start destinations?
13.What is the total number of unique stop destinations?
14. Display all the Uber trips that have San Francisco as the starting point.
15. What is the most popular starting point for the Uber drivers?
16. What is the most popular dropping point for the Uber drivers?
17. List the most frequent route taken by Uber drivers.
18. Display all types of purposes for the trip in an array.
19. Plot a bar graph of Purpose vs. Miles (Distance).
20. Display a DataFrame of Purpose and the distance traveled for that particular Purpose.
21. Plot the number of trips vs. Category of trips.
22. What is the proportion of miles covered as Business trips, and what is the proportion of miles covered as Personal trips?
# Prerequisites
